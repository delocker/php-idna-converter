This converter allows you to transfer domain names between the encoded (Punycode) notation and the decoded (UTF-8) notation.
Just enter the domain name in the respective field and click on the button right below it to have it converted. Please note, that you might even enter complete domain names (like jürgen-müller.de) or a email addresses.

Make sure, that your browser is capable of the UTF-8 character encoding.

For those of you interested in the PHP source of the underlying class, you might download it here.

Please be aware, that this class is provided as is and without any liability. Use at your own risk.
To ensure, that a certain string has been converted correctly, you should convert it both ways and compare the results.
